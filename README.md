### Motion Extraction

This Python program enhances motion visibility in video streams using OpenCV. It applies specialized processing and compositing algorithms to emphasize movement patterns within the footage. This makes subtle motions more apparent and clear, which is particularly useful for:
- Security analysis and surveillance
- Biological research applications (e.g., studying animal behavior or cellular movement)
- Motion pattern analysis
- Movement trajectory visualization

The program processes video frames through various algorithms to highlight and amplify motion, making otherwise subtle movements more visible to the human eye.

### Video Stabilization

The video stabilization implementation is based on the ICCV 2023 paper "Fast Full-frame Video Stabilization with Iterative Optimization" by Zhao et al. This approach provides real-time stabilization while maintaining high-quality frame preservation.

#### How It Works

1. **Motion Extraction**

   - The algorithm analyzes consecutive frames to compute motion trajectories
   - Features are detected using FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) corners
   - KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) tracking is employed to track these features across frames

2. **Stabilization Process**

   - **Motion Estimation**:
     - Extracts camera motion by analyzing feature correspondences
     - Computes homography matrices between consecutive frames
   - **Path Optimization**:
     - Implements iterative optimization to smooth camera paths
     - Uses a sliding window approach for real-time processing
     - Minimizes both trajectory smoothness and content preservation

3. **Frame Transformation**
   - Applies computed transformations to stabilize frames
   - Maintains frame boundaries to minimize empty borders
   - Uses edge-aware interpolation for high-quality frame warping

#### Key Features

- Real-time processing capability
- Minimal computing resource requirements
- Adaptive smoothing based on motion intensity
- Preservation of intentional camera movements
- Reduction of high-frequency jitter

The implementation provides a balance between stabilization quality and processing speed, making it suitable for real-time applications while maintaining professional-grade output quality.
